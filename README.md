## How To
![photo](/img/2.png)
- Attach the bear to the tumbler.
- And drink water by touching him.
- As we pushes the sensor on his body, the bear can drink water as much as I drink.
- But, if we doesn't drink for a day, the bear will cry out.
- Please drink some water so that he won't cry :)
- This mini project has been implemented by using Aduino UNO and Bluetooth Shield along with a few lines of simple code.
