1. Attach the bear to the tumbler.
2. And drink water by touching him.
3. As we pushes the sensor on his body, the bear can drink water as much as I drink.
4. But, if we doesn't drink for a day, the bear will cry out.
5. Please drink some water so that he won't cry :)
6. This mini project has been implemented by using Aduino UNO and Bluetooth Shield along with a few lines of simple code.
